			 * Fixed an issue causing the game to crash when using the material list key on anything but the Copy&Paste Gadget or air.
		BuildingGadgets-2.7.0.jar:
			Full Changelog [here](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

			Note:

			A note for this update, due to the pure amount of changes made between this version and the previous version we're just going to put it out there that this one might be a bit buggy! 🐛 If you encounter any issues with how the mod used to work to how it works now please be sure to create a new issue on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/issues)

			Added

			 *  Added a new and fancy Material List GUI for templates. Simply shift right click with a template in your hand to see the list.
			 * With this you can also now copy the material list right into your clipboard!
			 * Some people where finding it hard to open the Copy & Paste Gadgets GUI in tight spaces so to help with this we've added a button in the Radial Menu (G) to go straight to it :)
			Changed

			 *  The Building and Exchanging Gadgets mode System, to make it more open for future additions. Thanks @hnOsmium001 for his PR.
			 * This also resulted in a lot of changes - please report any bugs you might encounter as a lot of the core functionality has been changed in this version.
			 * Updated the Destruction Gadget's GUI as it needed some scaling and usability work. It's better but it's not pretty! Soz.
			 * The destruction gadget now uses a different kind of magic for finding connected blocks. This should resolve any issues people have been having with less powerful computers and large selection ranges.
			 * Added slightly better handling of random crashes to hopefully reduce them... Wish us luck.
			Fixed

			 * Fix typo when pasting a link
			 * Fixed an issue where linked inventories (Yeah, you can link loads of them now. Just shift right click with a supported Gadget!) would stay highlighted in different dimensions.
			 * Fixed an odd one where linked inventories would throw out items if the dimension got deleted.
			 * Fixed an exploit where the Exchanging Gadget could be used as a way to mine large areas quickly.
			 * Fixed an issue with the new modes system using the Building Gadgets range in Build To Me mode which wasn't even close to right.
			For Devs

			 * We're now firing Break & Place block events for each of our tools semi correctly. We've not been able to do large scale tests so if you have any more issues then let us know.
		BuildingGadgets v2.6.8:
			Full Changelog: [https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

			Added

			 * Added settings to the radial menu for rotation, mirroring, undoing, and anchoring. All operations that can be performed by a keybind can now be performed via the radial menu.
			 * A Building or Exchanging gadget can now rotate/mirror its selected blockstate (using either its new keybind, which is not set by default, or using the radial menu).
			 * Example: Selecting a stair block, then rotating it.
			Changed

			 * Separated rotation/mirror keybind (not set by default) from range (still default of R).
			 * Raised the energy costs in recipes to 4000/1000 from
			 * 400/100 in the pulverizer and fluid extractor [Thermal Expansion]
			 * 1600/400 in the crusher [Immersive Engineering]

			Added

			 * The copy/paste gadget can now mirror pastes, as well as rotate them. Sneak while pressing the keybind that previously just rotated them to mirror them left-to-right instead.

			 * Converted text-based settings controls to icon-based ones.
			 * Prevented mode strings from rendering when the cursor is not over its corresponding slice.
			 * Added range slider.
			 * Allowed gadgets to bind Simple Storage Network networks as a remote inventories (you can only bind the Storage Network Master block).
			 * Dense construction blocks now drop 1-3 (configurable) construction paste items.
			 * The process of generating construction paste is now as follows:

			 * Convert the powder into a dense construction block by either placing it in the word next to water, or using one of the following machines:
			 * Fluid Transposer [Thermal Expansion]
			 * Hydrator [Cyclic]
			 * Moistener [Forestry]
			 * Get paste from the block by either:
			 * Breaking it, yielding 1-3 paste.
			 * Using machines:
			 * Convert it into dense construction chunks (1 block -> 4 chunks):
			 * Pulverizer [Thermal Expansion]
			 * Macerator [Industrial Craft 2]
			 * Grinder [Applied Energistics 2]
			 * Crusher [Mekanism]
			 * Crusher [Immersive Engineering]
			 * Crusher [Actually Additions]
			 * Convert the chunks into paste using any of the machines listed in step 3 (1 chunk -> 1 paste).
			Changed

			 * Nearly every ingredient of every recipe now uses the ore dictionary.

	Xaero's Minimap (went from v1.16.2 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12 to v1.17.4 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12):
		v1.17.4 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12:
			* Fixed incompatibility with Divine RPG and potentially other mods that add dimensions. Although it's very unlikely, this fix can, in theory, also "break" automatic sub-world detection for some modded dimensions that previously worked fine but you can easily fix it via the "Options" button in the waypoints menu. The "Make Sub-world Auto" option is what you're looking for.
			* Improved the fix for the file path case sensitivity issue. Newly visited dimensions will now also correctly detect the existing world/server id with the different letter cases.
		v1.17.3 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's World Map 1.4+.
		v1.17.2 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12:
			* Fixed compatibility with BetterPortals mod or similar mods that keep multiple worlds loaded at once on client side. A similar fix is coming to Xaero's World Map.
			* Improved Greek translation. Huge thanks to VasilisGR!
		v1.17.1 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12:
			+ Added a new keybinding for toggling whether all waypoint sets for the current world are rendered or just the currently selected one.
			* Fixed waypoints saving issues caused by non case-sensitive path handling on some OS including Windows. If your OS uses case-sensitive paths (for example Linux) and you have multiple IDs with the same name but different character cases (left from deleted worlds), then this fix might change which world ID is considered "auto". You can easily solve this using the "Options" menu in the waypoints screen.
		v1.17 for Minecraft 1.12.2 | 1.12.1 | 1.12:
			+ Added scrolling to dropdown menus when they don't fit in the screen. For example, world/server or sub-world lists.
